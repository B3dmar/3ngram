# @3ngram/core

## 0.5.1

### Patch Changes

- e18e4a2: Bound every non-health HTTP surface with a coarse per-IP rate limit and replace trailing-slash regular expressions with linear-time normalization.
- Updated dependencies [e18e4a2]
  - @3ngram/llm@0.2.2

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 3d1f0ec: Add the REST-only ARCHIVE lifecycle operation: `POST /api/v1/memories/:id/archive` flips an active memory of any type to `status='archived'` (leaving `valid_to` NULL, so the row lands in the archived bucket that `GET /api/v1/memories?status=archived` and `GET /api/v1/stats` read) and records an `archive` audit event in the same transaction. Adoption-gate Decision D: no MCP tool mirrors this surface.

### Patch Changes

- b956a15: Ship complete public package metadata, package-level license and notice files,
  and focused package READMEs. Add a working `3ngram --version` command.
- b956a15: Add billing-neutral, optional live-memory and active-MCP-client limit primitives
  with exact transactional enforcement, explicit transport errors, and an exported
  server compatibility sentinel. Omitted limits remain unlimited for self-hosting.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- fb2487a: Reshape into a clean, self-hostable OSS core. Remove the billing/subscription surface and replace the `CloudExtension` seam with a neutral `Extension` seam (`resolveLimits` / `AccessGate` / `onAccountDeletion` / export enricher), all with no-op self-host defaults. Keep the budget cost-cap as a self-host feature. Consolidate docs into a single Mintlify tree and make CI fork-friendly (pgvector service container instead of hosted branches).
