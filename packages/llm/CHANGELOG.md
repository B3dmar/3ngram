# @3ngram/llm

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- b956a15: Ship complete public package metadata, package-level license and notice files,
  and focused package READMEs. Add a working `3ngram --version` command.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- fb2487a: Reshape into a clean, self-hostable OSS core. Remove the billing/subscription surface and replace the `CloudExtension` seam with a neutral `Extension` seam (`resolveLimits` / `AccessGate` / `onAccountDeletion` / export enricher), all with no-op self-host defaults. Keep the budget cost-cap as a self-host feature. Consolidate docs into a single Mintlify tree and make CI fork-friendly (pgvector service container instead of hosted branches).

## 0.1.1

Initial public release.
