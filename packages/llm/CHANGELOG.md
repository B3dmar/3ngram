### Minor Changes

- 809ae0e: Add the session closer (issue #166 step 6): a lease-expiry sweep plus a resolve-only closer job on the worker, both **default-off** behind `SESSION_CLOSER_ENABLED`.

  The sweep is the producer the crash path lacked — a killed terminal touches no row, so nothing else would ever triage a dead session. It stamps an implicit `closedAt` on rows quiet for the lease plus a new one-hour grace, and hands each closed, untriaged run to the closer. The grace is load-bearing: it keeps the stamped `closedAt` outside the `closedAt <= lastSeenAt + lease` window that identifies an explicit `SessionEnd` forever, so a swept row still resurrects on a later heartbeat or resume.

  The closer claims the run with a compare-and-set on `triageAttemptId` fenced at the observed `activationEpoch`, makes ONE LLM pass over the run's briefed commitments, this-run event kinds and the bounded last-message excerpt, then live-re-reads and `resolve`s the commitments the model says the work completed. It writes nothing else — no `remember`, no `revise`, no `archive`. `resolve` is reversible via `unresolve`, which is what makes a retried model pass safe: it cannot append a duplicate corpus row. The model's reply is strict-parsed and then intersected with the briefed id set, so it cannot resolve a commitment it was never shown. The epoch is re-checked on the final write-back, so a resurrection mid-pass abandons the attempt instead of landing on a session the user has resumed.

  The generation is **metered and bounded**. `session.closer` joins the operation registry as the first `generation`-class entry, and the pass reserves against the tenant's budget before the call, records one `llm_usage` row after it, and releases the reservation — the same seam every embed call site uses, so an over-cap pass is rejected rather than silently billed. Output tokens are capped per call. `Gateway.complete()` is implemented for the OpenAI-compatible gateway (it previously threw `NotImplementedError`) and now returns `{ text, usage, model }` rather than a bare string, so callers can price the call; it accepts `maxOutputTokens` and an optional JSON-object response format, and holds its timeout until the response body is consumed rather than releasing it when headers arrive.

  Closer jobs are removed from Redis immediately on both terminal states. The job id is deterministic on `(run, epoch)` and a retained job keeps its id reserved, so anything short of immediate removal leaves a run un-enqueueable: a retained-count policy only rotates when another job finishes, which on a low-volume deployment never happens. The trade is that a persistently failing row is re-enqueued once per sweep tick rather than once ever — bounded, self-healing, and budget-capped — and the `worker: job failed` log (job id, attempt counts, error name; no content) becomes the durable trace in place of the failed-set entry.

  `SESSION_CLOSER_ENABLED` is a **kill switch, not just a first-boot default**. BullMQ job schedulers are durable in Redis, so turning the flag off removes the registered sweep scheduler and additionally makes both processors no-op — a deployment that once ran with the closer on stops closing rows and stops billing generation on the next restart.

  `renderDebriefPrompt` moves from `apps/server` to `@3ngram/core` so the closer renders the same registrar as the MCP prompt and the REST route; the rendered text is unchanged. `transitionCommitment` gains `stampedSessionRunId` for provenance a caller has already resolved — the closer's rows are closed by construction, so the normal attach path would resurrect them — and an optional `expectedFrom` compare-and-set guard, which raises the new `CommitmentStateChangedError` when the row moved between a caller's live read and its write. Without it a lost race still wrote: the FSM trigger passes `resolved -> resolved` straight through, re-stamping `resolvedAt` and appending a duplicate `resolve` event under the loser's provenance.

  The compare-and-set guard applies to the interactive `resolve` surfaces too, so a user resolving a commitment the closer is resolving concurrently no longer appends a second `resolve` event. Losing that race is resolved silently where it can be — the loser re-reads and returns the ordinary idempotent success when the commitment already reached the requested status, and reports the _actual_ from-status when it did not — so the only user-visible change is a new `409 conflict` (MCP: `conflict: commitment is no longer '<status>'; retry`) in the rare case where concurrent writers keep moving the row out from under every attempt.

  Migration `0033` adds a partial index for the closer's candidate scan (`closed_at IS NOT NULL`, excluding the terminal status) — the opposite predicate to the lease index, which therefore could not serve it. No new table; the count stays 27.

  `apps/worker` gains a Dockerfile and a service in **both** `docker-compose.yml` and `compose.selfhost.yml`. Without them a self-host stack enqueued into a void.

  Enabling the closer is a later, measured decision: the validation bar is a positive commitment-recall improvement against the documented 0% baseline, judged by a dogfood audit rather than by CI.

## 0.2.4

### Patch Changes

- Keep `engines.node` at `>=22`. The Node 24 work should only have moved what we build, test and ship on — CI and the container base — not what consumers must run. Nothing in this closure uses a Node 24 feature, and Node 22 is supported upstream until 2027-04-30, so raising the published floor would have hard-failed Node 22 consumers on a patch release. Raising it becomes a deliberate major when there is a reason.

## 0.2.3

### Patch Changes

- 6e06cd6: Build, test and ship on Node 24 (Active LTS). CI, the release workflow and the server image base move to Node 24 — `node:24-bookworm-slim`, digest-pinned. `engines.node` deliberately stays `>=22`: nothing here requires a Node 24 feature, so consumers on Node 22 (supported until 2027-04-30) remain supported.

## 0.2.2

### Patch Changes

- e18e4a2: Bound every non-health HTTP surface with a coarse per-IP rate limit and replace trailing-slash regular expressions with linear-time normalization.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- b956a15: Ship complete public package metadata, package-level license and notice files,
  and focused package READMEs. Add a working `3ngram --version` command.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- fb2487a: Reshape into a clean, self-hostable OSS core. Remove the billing/subscription surface and replace the `CloudExtension` seam with a neutral `Extension` seam (`resolveLimits` / `AccessGate` / `onAccountDeletion` / export enricher), all with no-op self-host defaults. Keep the budget cost-cap as a self-host feature. Consolidate docs into a single Mintlify tree and make CI fork-friendly (pgvector service container instead of hosted branches).

## 0.1.1

Initial public release.
