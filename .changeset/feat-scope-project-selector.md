Add the `scope_project` orientation selector variant (issue #46): `{kind:'scope_project', scope, project, includeUnscoped}` selects the scope AND project intersection the shipped union could not express, with `includeUnscoped` (default false) as the opt-in NULL-project mitigation — `scope = $s AND (project = $p OR ($includeUnscoped AND project IS NULL))` in the single `memoryScopePredicate` all six briefing sections and handoff inherit. The V2 selector union (`briefingSelectorV2Schema`, packages/schema/src/briefing-bounds.ts) is composed from the shipped variant objects, so the three shipped variants stay byte-identical and the bare `project` variant is NOT widened. Core `requireSelector` validates the new variant; the published `BriefingSelector` type carries it with a required `includeUnscoped`.
