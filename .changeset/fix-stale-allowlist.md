Restrict the briefing's `staleCandidates` section to a reviewable memory-type allowlist: `memory_type IN ('decision', 'preference', 'blocker', 'fact')`. The previous predicate excluded only `commitment`, so every other live memory older than the 30-day stale window qualified — in production that matched ~74% of active memories (dominated by bulk-imported `event`/`note` rows) and made the section unusable noise. The allowlist is core policy (`STALE_CANDIDATE_TYPES`, exported beside `STALE_WINDOW_DAYS`) and fails closed: future or imported memory types are excluded by default. `packages/db`'s `staleCandidates` now accepts the allowlist as an OPTIONAL trailing parameter (after `limit`); when omitted, the legacy NOT-`commitment` filter applies, so existing five-argument callers keep both their signature and their prior behavior. The briefing output shape is unchanged.
