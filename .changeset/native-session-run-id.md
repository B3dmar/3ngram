Native writes accept optional `sessionRunId` and stamp `{ sessionRunId }` on audit events. Import still rejects the key. Unknown run ids fail the write; an explicitly closed row succeeds unattributed and is never resurrected; a stale lease resurrects then attaches, and a successful attach refreshes the lease. Concurrent writes carrying the same stale run id resurrect it exactly once — `activationEpoch` advances one step per resurrection, never one per writer, so a claim fenced at the new epoch stays valid. Omitted id uses the single leased-open session for the project. `POST /api/v1/memories/:id/archive` gains an optional body carrying the same field, and the SDK's `resolve()` takes an optional `{ sessionRunId }`. The SDK's `remember()` now takes/returns the facts-capable `RememberToolArgsV2`/`RememberToolOutputV2` types instead of the V1 pair. Resolving a commitment to the status it already holds stays idempotent but now validates a supplied `sessionRunId` too: such a request previously succeeded with an unowned or nonexistent id and is now rejected as invalid input, the same as every other native write. Lease refreshes are monotonic — a heartbeat or resurrect can only move `lastSeenAt` forward, so a slow writer cannot shorten a lease a later one already extended.
